# The Maze-ry by Kristin Dragos

## About
This game is a project for the Udacity's VR Developer Nanodegree program. The goal is to create a maze game. Users need to use waypoints to navigate the world and progress through the game. Users collect coins as they work and must find a key to open the door to win the game. 

## Enhancements
This is still a work in progress. My ideas for enhancing this game include: 

- Adding additional levels.
- Potentially more challenging, procedurely generated layouts.
- Sound effects.
- Animations.
- A helpful creature to provide hints. 
- A heads up display (HUD) containing: (1) a graphic for the key. A gray icon will indicate that the key isn't picked up yet. A gold key indicates it has been collected. (2) a place to track score (collected coins).

## Challenges and Reflection
This will be added after I'm finished with the project.
